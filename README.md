# Evolve

## Important Scripting Edition Update

The Scripting Edition of Evolve will be retired on 12 March 2021.

As there is now a more up to date script that works with the original version of Evolve there is no longer any reason to continue to maintain a separate Scripting Edition of the game. You should install the new script and migrate your save to the original version of Evolve before 12 March 2021.

What you need to do:
1. Export your save game from the Scripting Edition and store it somewhere safe (you should be making a regular backup of your save game anyway!)
1. Export your current script settings and store them somewhere safe
1. Import your save game into the original version of Evolve at https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/
1. IMPORTANT: In the original game settings tab you must enable the following settings: "Enable Debug Mode" and "Preload Tab Content"
1. If you are already using Vollch's script
    1. Import your current script settings into the original version of Evolve at https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/
1. If you are not already using Vollch's script
    1. Uninstall the existing Evolve script from Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey
    1. Install the new script maintained by Vollch from https://gist.github.com/Vollch/b1a5eec305558a48b7f4575d317d7dd1 (Click the "Raw" button on the page to install the script automatically in Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey)
    1. Import your current script settings into the original version of Evolve at https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/
    1. Explore some of the new script settings available in Vollch's script. He's done a great job expanding on the available functionality!
